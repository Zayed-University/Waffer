# Waffer

Waffer application project aims to be of an assistance to sustainable living by ensuring that electricity power is not left unused. It is not limited to be used by adults only, for it works for both adults and children. Waffer will be using two sensors to detect who’s walking inside a room so that it can notify them to turn off the light, and to send over a notification to the local electricity company and pay the bills electronically. However, for when it is used by children, as soon as a child walks be it shows a message on a touch screen with the message “Would you like to turn off the light? ”. Then the child can see that and willingly turn of the light. Arduino is also used for the project as well to turn off the lights automatically if there is no one in the room.
